Because PCs persist between encounters, this program doesn't attempt to track expendables like spell slots.

PCs can be added using \"Define PC\" or added/modified using the \"PC Manager\" which can be found under the \"Edit\" tab."

Once an NPC is defined, it is available in the \"Add NPC\" popup such that it can be added to the encounter.
Additionally, multiple NPCs can be selected at once and multiple identical NPCs can be added using the \"# to add\" box in the lower right of the Add NPC popup.

During an encounter, when it's an NPC's turn, you may use actions by clicking the action economy buttons in the lower left panel. 
They're mostly there for reminders though (e.g. multiple attacks).
Additionally, on an NPC's turn, the NPC info shown in the bottom right panel should be updated. There you can see the spell book/slots and all additional entered info (e.g. Legendary/Normal actions)."

A \"Scratch Text\" popup can be shown using either the hotkey Ctrl+T or in the Options menu.

When a PC is bloodied, their name text turns red.
When an NPC is bloodied, their \"status indicator square\" (white be default) turns red for even easier tracking.
On death PC name text/NPC status indicator square turns black.
You can decrement HP below 0 to track death saves.

Applied statuses are complicated.
Because of that, when adding a status to a PC or NPC, you have the option to auto-decrement the status (at the end of that character's turn). When that counter hits 0, it's automatically deleted. You can also manually delete statuses using the \"X\" button.

Thanks to my kind DM friends who've play-tested this tool and offered great feedback. I'm incapable of incorporating it all though so if there are any good parts, it's probably their contribution and rough edges are my own design inadequacies."
